### Ethics in Data Science

I think ethics in data science is the topic we haven’t had a chance to discuss. Data science can be a revolutionary tool for human development; however, it’s important to consider the ethics of data science processes. I think this topic would lead to a fruitful discussion because it’s a rather simple yet opinionated topic. I find TED Talks very interesting because of their specificity and conciseness. It’s important to note that most TED talks are shorter than videos we have been assigned for this class previously, so I think it would be good to possibly assign multiple of them. Most speakers who are invited to do a TED Talk are very passionate about their field, and it shows through the screen, making it interesting for students to watch. 

#### A few TED Talks that I found regarding ethics in data science are listed below:
