### Worldwide Corruption Perception Index vs. Happiness score (2011-2016)

  The x-axis displays the corruption perception index, which is a score of perceptions of corruption (higher values signify less corruption). The y-axis represents the happiness score, measured by the Cantril life ladder method. The plotted data shows an evident positive relationship between happiness score and the corruption perception index, where the higher the corruption perception index is, the happier people of that country feel.  Almost all data points follow the upward trending curve, with minimal outliers.  

  Venezuela’s data in 2011 was interesting to examine in the sense that the country had an extremely low corruption perception index of 18, and yet the happiness score in Venezuela was above 70. Tracking the country’s data throughout the next 5 years showed that the corruption perception index stayed roughly the same, yet the happiness score took a significant fall of 35 happiness points during 2015. The significant change over the relatively small time period may have been caused by Venezuela's economic crisis, when the government under President Maduro decided to cut public funding. The opposition Democratic Unity coalition won control of Venezuela’s legislative body. Many Venezuelans took part in prolonged protests to remove Maduro from office, accusing him of causing the economic crisis. This data connects to Amartya Sen’s proposed idea of interconnected freedoms. The freedom of speech and protest that Venezuelans have allows them to stand up for their  future economic freedom, which in turn can impact their overall happiness score.

  The data for most countries supports Sen’s idea of the importance of freedom. A developed country is generally thought to have content and happy people living in it. Therefore, the fact that a higher corruption perception index, signifying lower corruption, translates into a higher happiness score, indicates that having a non-corrupt government grants people political and social freedom, which in turn makes people happy and content to live in that country.
