Business is a field that uses data science disciplines. Data analysis can be used to understand buyer behavior better. Since companies are typically aiming towards higher profit and more sales, understanding customer habits, demographic characteristics, and preferences can be of worth to a company. One example could be tracking a companyâ€™s website usage and analyzing how long customers spend there or which tabs are the most frequently used. Similarly, statistics can then be used to survey a population on their opinions of the brand. A carefully crafted survey can be highly useful to the company to better understand customer behavior. Machine learning too can be used in business to optimize processes and save human resources. Online chatbots are one example. Many companies have a window at the bottom of the screen that initiates a conversation with a company-created chatbot. A chatbot can direct customers to necessary tabs, reply to questions, and, if necessary, connect customers with a human. Machine learning, in the case of chat-bots, allows for a faster response time and a variety of saved human resources. Overall, data science can successfully be used in many fields with business being one of them.
