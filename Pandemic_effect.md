Almost all fields, including business, has been affected by COVID. Areas of business most severely impacted by the pandemic are tourism and travel. Many countries closed their borders leaving tourism dependent countries under financial suffering. Domestic travel, too, was negatively affected because people felt unsafe staying in hotels. Similarly, the airline business was severely damaged by the pandemic caused by the low demand of travel. There is a clear net-negative change that occurred in the business field because of the COVID pandemic. Nonetheless, there are some positive findings that were discovered as a result of the pandemic, such as peopleâ€™s ability to work from home. This eliminates the need to rent out office space, which is a major cost for business companies. Though not preferred by some individuals, remote work may be the future of many fields including business. I think that with appropriate technological and operational systems, the work-from-home model can be profitable for the business field.
